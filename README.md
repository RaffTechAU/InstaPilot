# InstaPilot
While the native Autopilot experience may suffice for bulk enrolments through CSVs, many organisations exchange devices frequently and are in need of a more immediate and holistic solution. InstaPilot is a PowerShell script that builds on the existing Autopilot services with a focus on efficiency and ease of use. When used in conjunction with an autounattend.xml task sequence, InstaPilot augments the Windows Out-of-Box-Experience by automatically launching a thorough and efficient PowerShell task-sequence with the goal to prepare the device for use quickly and easily. 
The core functionality of InstaPilot is the simple GUI frontend for importing devices. Instead of manually inputting group-tags through Intune or other scripts, InstaPilot generates a list of the Deployment Profiles available from the connected Intune tenant, allowing IT admins to easily import individual devices into Autopilot with the configuration they desire. 
In addition, InstaPilot utilises a driver direct-download links as well as the PSWindowsUpdate module to ensure the device is fully up-to-date before proceeding with the Autopilot provisioning.
